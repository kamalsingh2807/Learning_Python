    "Let us take an example, we create a class which has a method calculate() which calculates the square of the number. But if we want to different objects to perform different tasks like to calculate square, square root and cube with the same method i.e. calculate() then the function processing will be dependent on the object being taken as if we are squaring a number we cannot perform sqaure root with the same function, and here we use the concept of Abstract classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "First We create a class in which we declare a method calculate() with no body( abstract method ) and this class is called *Abstract Class*.\n",
    "Secondly, we create subclasses for this class for different tasks, like sub1 for squaring the number, sub2 for squareroot, etc. and provide body( or implementation ) for calculate() method. So different subclasses will have different implementation for calculate() method, performing different tasks independently. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Hence we are no provding any body of the methods, no memory is allocated to the class and consequently PVM cannot create object of Abstract Class but we can create object of subclass with which we can access the methods of abstract class and can manipulate it.\n",

    "    \n",
