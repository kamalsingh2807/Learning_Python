    "**Poly**: *many* **morphism**: *many* , used to show that something exhibits many forms. E.g.: Flour can be converted to Bread,Burger,Roti. So in case of programming, variable, objects adn methods also exhibit the same nature of having different forms. Variable can point to several kinds of objects, and objects may  take different behaviours with different context, or methods( a single )  may perform multiple tasks. This is called polymorphism. \n",
